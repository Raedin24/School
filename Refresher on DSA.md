# For the motion
1. Putting the fictional tag does not give them the freedom to write anything they want. A real person with the name is going to be affected badly by the fictional story.
2. 
# Against the motion
1. The "fictional" tag given means that the name, unless uniquely identifying, cannot be referring to a real person
2. Freedom of expression : writers are allowed to create and share written content as they imagine
3. The first amendment protects people's rights to express themselves. 
4. No real harm was caused to the individual in question
