- Build code from scratch
- Follow suggested paper as template
- If dataset of paper is too large, substitute with other data with similar features
- Try these steps and run code over the weekend to evaluate performance

# Goals
i) An outperforming CNN-based computer-aided brain tumor diagnosis system for an early and reliable detection of brain tumor to assist in the rapid treatment planning 
ii) A technique consisting of preprocessing on images, feature extraction, reduction of feature space, and finally classification of images into positive and negative diagnoses of brain tumor 
iii) Improvement in CNN performance by applying geometrical and statistical data augmentation techniques on brain tumor MRI 
iv) Evaluation of the power of CNN by classifying totally unseen data, consisting of the six latest brain tumor MRI datasets 
v) Producing up to 100% accuracy by the trained CNN model 
vi) Achieving a high average sensitivity, i.e., 0.99 for all the datasets 
vii) A comprehensive comparative analysis with the other existing systems
