**Convolutional neural networks (CNN)** are best at processing images.
Consists of 2 parts
- *Convolutional  base* - Used to extract features from an image. Formed primarily of layers performing the convolution operation
- *Dense head* - Used to determine the class of the image. Formed primarily of dense layers
Goal of the network is to learn 2 things
1. Which features to extra
