parameter - aka population parameter
sample - a subset of population under study
parameter - quantity to know about population
statistics - estimate of the parameter from sample

external validity: is the estimate from the sample generalizable?
internal validity: is the estimate / statistic biased


## Study Designs

**Observational** - observing people living their lives, record data without interfering. **no control**
**Experimental** - attempt to control or manipulate the situation. **control**

### Observational Study Design
- Case Study / Series - exploratory analysis of one / few cases. usually clinical in nature. aka *n of 1* study
- Descriptive  - goal is to describe the features of a population
- Ecological - a group is used as one unit for observation
>[!NOTE] Ecological fallacy
>When inference about individuals is based on aggregate data
- Cross-sectional study - data collected at a single point in time. lack temporality (cannot determine the order of events)
- Case-control study - select cases and controls. suitable for studying real diseases, relatively quick and inexpensive. also lacks temporality. also prone to recall bias (participant might not accurately recall info). Cannot estimate prevalence/incidence as compared to *cross-sectional study*
- Cohort study - subjects are selected based on exposure status
