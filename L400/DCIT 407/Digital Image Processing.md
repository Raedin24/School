A *digital image*  **I (r, c)** is represented as a *two-dimensional*  array of data, where each pixel value corresponds to the brightness of the image at the point (r, c).
- In linear algebra, **I** is known as a *matrix*, and one row or column is a *vector*.

## Image Types
1. Binary Image
	- Only takes two values ie. **black** and **white**, or **0** and **1**
	- Is a **1 bit/pixel** image, meaning it takes 1 binary digit to represent each pixel
2. Gray Scale Image
	- Known as **monochrome** or one-colour image
	- Only contains brightness information
	- Is a **8 bit/pixel** image, thus having **0 - 255**  levels of brightness
	`8 bit representation is because the byte(8 bits) is the standard small unit in computers`
