A *colour space* is a mathematical model describing how colours can be represented.
- It is described in a *specific*, *measurable* and *fixed* range of possible colours and luminance values.
- **OpenCV** can be used to manipulate colour spaces. Written in C/C++, with Python bindings
## RGB Colour Space
- The image is represented as a combination of three colours: *red, blue, green*.
- Each colour is represented by a value ranging from **0 to 255**. 
- Combining the 3 can create all possible colours in the visible spectrum

## HSV Colour Space
HSV stands for *Hue, Saturation* and *Value*
