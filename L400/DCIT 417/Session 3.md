A wireless network can be 
1. *AP-based* - there is a central device (access point) that connects different terminal devices eg. router
2. *Ad hoc based*  - The end devices form connections among themselves when there is a need to transmit information
	- In situations where the communicating devices are out of the range of the other device, a node/terminal device can act as an intermediary and transmit packets b/n
