**Network Simulators**
1. ns-2
2. ns-3
3. OMNeT++
4. openWNS
5. Vienna LTE Simulator

**When to use Simulation**
1. Real computing system not available - Can be due to
	1. Complexity: large networks
	2. Cost: space communications, satellite
	3. Danger: PPDR systems, emergency networks
2. Quick alternative evaluation of
	1. Network topology: star/mesh networks
	2. TCP / UDP for an app
	3. WiMAX or LTE connections
3. Evaluating complex analytical models where the optimal formula is unavailable
	1. QoS solutions
	2. Optimization routing for WSN
	3. Channel access techniques 

**Advantages of Simulation**
1. Cheaper
2. Bugs can be discovered early
3. Can be applied in a wide range (numerical techniques, over topology)
4. Can be tuned to detail

**Disadvantages of Simulation**
1. Accuracy - Might not reflect reality
2. Computationally expensive for large systems
3. Might be slow
