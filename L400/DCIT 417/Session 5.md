## Characteristics of Queuing Systems
- Arrivals
- Service
- Line (queue)
- Departures
- Single server
- Multiple server
- finite and infinite queue length
- Finite and infinite population
Can be combined to have queuing systems with particular characteristics

**Queuing theory** helps in determining the time that the jobs spend in various queues in the system. This time can be used to predict the response time
Queuing model is a  universal mathematical model that is used for 
`Routers often use a priority based scheme for packets`
An *open system* takes requests from outside the system and sends responses back outside. It's only possible to control the responses going out, not necessarily those coming in.
