Arrivals are assigned a server based on the queuing discipline.
Types of Multiple Server Queuing Systems
1. Multi-server
2. Multi-server multi-queue
3. Multi-server

$$ prob(state 1) = (\gamma + \lambda )\pi_1
$$
For K number of customers, the state is found by
$$ \pi_k = \frac{1}{k!}(\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^k\pi_0 $$
where k = no of customers, 
\pi_0 = initial state
mu = service rate
lambda = arrival rate
