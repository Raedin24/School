- Network performance analysis might be done to compare the performances of different protocols on a network.
- It might also be done to see how a prototype of a network might work

Performance can be measured through
1. Mathematical model
2. Computational simulations
3. Experiments
4. Test beds - Where the experiments are done on a small scale with only a few devices. Usually done right after simulation.
`Mathematical modelling is the furthermost from reality because there is a lot of abstraction involved in the calculation, as the model cannot account for all the variables that would be present in the real world`
