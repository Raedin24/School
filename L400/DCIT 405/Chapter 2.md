## Selection Bias
The practice of selectively choosing data in a way that leads to misleading conclusions
Forms:
	- *Data snooping* - Extensively hunting through data in search of something interesting
	- *Vast search effect* - Bias resulting from repeated data modeling, or modeling data with large numbers of predictor variables.
	- *Nonrandom*
- Using a *holdout set* to validate performance can guard against selection bias.
- Use *target shuffling*, which is a permutation test, to test the validity of predictive associations that a model suggests
