# 15.1 Static Routes
## 15.1.1 Types of Static Routes
Static routes can be configured for IPv4 and IPv6.
Four types of static routes:
1. Standard static route
2. Default static route
3. Floating static route
4. Summary static route

## 15.1.2 Next-Hop Options
The next hop can be identified either by an *IP address*, *exit interface*, or both. How the destination is identified creates one of **3** types of static route
1. **Next-hop route** - Only next-hop IP address specified
2. **Directly connected static route** - Only router exit interface specified
3. **Fully specified static route** - Both next-hop IP and exit interface specified
