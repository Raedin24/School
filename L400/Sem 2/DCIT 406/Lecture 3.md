# 3.5 Common Network Attacks
Networks are vulnerable to the ff types of attacks
1. Reconnaissance attacks
2. Access Attacks
3. DoS attacks
> Data becomes a payload once encapsulation has occured

### Reconnaissance Attacks
- Info gathering stage
- Used by threat actors to perform unauthorized discovery and mapping of systems, services and vulnerabilities
- Happens before access and DoS attacks

| Technique                    | Description                                                                                                           |

| Perform info query           | Used to look for initial info about a target. Tools used include Google search, organization website, whois, etc      |
| Ping sweep of target network | Used to reveal target network address and determine active IPs                                                        |
| Port scan of active IPs      | Used to determine which ports / services are available. Tools used include Nmap, SuperScan, Angry IP Scanner, NetScan |
| Run vulnerability scanners   |                                                                                                                       |
