# 1.1 OSPF Features and Characteristics
## Intro to OSPF
**OSPFv2** is used for IPv4 networks. **OSPFv3** is used for IPv6 networks.
- Is a *link-state* routing protocol
- Offers faster convergence and scales better to larger networks. **Convergence** is the rate at which information is being collected and shared
- Uses the concept of **areas** , with routing domains being divided into distinct areas
- A *link*  is 
	- an interface on a router
	- a network segment connecting two routers
	- a stub network connected to a single router
- *Link-state*  is the information about the state of a link. Includes
	- *Network prefix*
	- *Prefix length*
	- *Cost*

## Components of OSPF
All routing protocols have 3 main parts
1. **Routing Protocol Messages** - Used to exchange route info
2. **Data Structures** - Built using the messages exchanged
3. **Routing Algorithm** - Used to process the data structures

OSPF uses *5*  types of packets to discover neighbour routers and exchange routing info
1. Hello
2. Database description
3. Link-state request
4. Link-state update
5. Link-state acknowledgement

> ACK packets are always exchanged before information exchange begins

OSPF messages are used to create and maintain *3*  OSPF databases

| Database                 | Table          | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adjacency Database       | Neighbor Table | - Lists all neighbor routers with bi-directional comms. Unique for each router. `ip ospf neghbor`                    |
| Link-State Databse(LSDB) | Topology Table | - Lists info about all other routers in network. All routers in an area have identical LSDB. `show ip ospf database` |
| Forwarding Database      | Routing Table  | - Lists routes generated when an algorithm is run on the LSDB. Unique for each router. `show ip route`               |
> Tables are stored in the RAM.
> LSDB represents the network topology
> Topology table is built using Dijkstra's SPF algorithm
## Link-State Operation
1. Establish Neighbor Adjacencies
2. Exchange Link-State Advertisements
3. Build link state database
4. Execute the SPF algo
5. Choose the best route
