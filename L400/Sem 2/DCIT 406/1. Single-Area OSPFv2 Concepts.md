# 1.1 OSPF Features and Characteristics
## Intro to OSPF
**OSPFv2** is used for IPv4 networks. **OSPFv3** is used for IPv6 networks.
- Is a *link-state* routing protocol
- Offers faster convergence and scales better to larger networks. **Convergence** is the rate at which information is being collected and shared
- Uses the concept of **areas** , with routing domains being divided into distinct areas
- A *link*  is 
	- an interface on a router
	- a network segment connecting two routers
	- a stub network connected to a single router
- *Link-state*  is the information about the state of a link. Includes
	- *Network prefix*
	- *Prefix length*
	- *Cost*

## Components of OSPF
All routing protocols have 3 main parts
1. **Routing Protocol Messages** - Used to exchange route info
2. **Data Structures** - Built using the messages exchanged
3. **Routing Algorithm** - Used to process the data structures

OSPF uses *5*  types of packets to discover neighbour routers and exchange routing info
1. Hello
2. Database description
3. Link-state request
4. Link-state update
5. Link-state acknowledgement

> ACK packets are always exchanged before information exchange begins

OSPF messages are used to create and maintain *3*  OSPF databases

| Database                 | Table          | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adjacency Database       | Neighbor Table | - Lists all neighbor routers with bi-directional comms. Unique for each router. `ip ospf neghbor`                    |
| Link-State Databse(LSDB) | Topology Table | - Lists info about all other routers in network. All routers in an area have identical LSDB. `show ip ospf database` |
| Forwarding Database      | Routing Table  | - Lists routes generated when an algorithm is run on the LSDB. Unique for each router. `show ip route`               |
> Tables are stored in the RAM.
> LSDB represents the network topology
> Topology table is built using Dijkstra's SPF algorithm
## Link-State Operation
1. **Establish Neighbour Adjacencies** - Send hello packets on all OSPF-enabled interfaces to determine if neighbours are present
2. **Exchange Link-State Advertisements** - LSAs contain the state and cost of each directly connected link. LSAs are flooded to adjacent neighbours till all routers have all LSAs
3. **Build link state database** - LSAs are used to build the topology table
4. **Execute the SPF algo** - SPF is used to create the SPF tree containing all routes to a network
5. **Choose the best route** - The best route from SPF tree is added to the routing table

## Single-Area and Multiarea OSPF
- OSPF supports hierarchical routing using areas.
- An **OSPF area** is a group of routers that share the same link-state info in their LSDB
> Networks are usually connected to the ISP through area 0

**Single-Area OSPF** - All routers in one area (usually area 0)
**Multiarea OSPF** - Multiple areas in hierarchical style. All areas **must** connect to area 0 (aka *backbone area*). Routers connecting different areas are called *Area Border Routers (ABRs)*. Advantages are:
1. Smaller routing table
2. Reduces link-state update overhead
3. Reduces frequency of SPF calculations

## OSPFv3
- Similar to OSPFv2, but uses IPv6 as the network layer transport.
- Exchanges routing info to populate the IPv6 routing table with remote prefixes.
```
Network address > Prefix
Subnet mask > Prefix-length
```
