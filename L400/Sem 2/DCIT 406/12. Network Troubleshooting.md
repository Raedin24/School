# Network Documentation
## Documentation overview
Network documentation includes 
1. Physical and logical network topology diagrams
2. Network device documentation
3. Network performance baseline documentation

## Network Topology Diagrams
- Keeps track of the *location*, *function*, and *status* of devices
- Can be divided into 2 types
	- **Physical**: Shows the physical layout of the devices on the network. Helpful when troubleshooting physical layer problems. Includes info such as 
		- Device name
		- Device location
		- Interface and ports used
		- Cable type
	- **Logical**: Shows how devices are connected logically on the network (ie. how devices transfer data when communicating). Includes info such as
		- Device identifiers
		- IP addresses and prefix lengths
		- Interface identifiers
		- Routing protocols and static routes
		- Layer 2 info (VLANs, trunks, EtherChannels)
