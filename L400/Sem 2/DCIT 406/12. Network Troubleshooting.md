# Network Documentation
## Documentation overview
Network documentation includes 
1. Physical and logical network topology diagrams
2. Network device documentation
3. Network performance baseline documentation

## Network Topology Diagrams
- Keeps track of the *location*, *function*, and *status* of devices
- Can be divided into 2 types
	- **Physical**: Shows the physical layout of the devices on the network. Helpful when troubleshooting physical layer problems. Includes info such as 
		- Device name
		- Device location
		- Interface and ports used
		- Cable type
	- **Logical**: Shows how devices are connected logically on the network (ie. how devices transfer data when communicating). Includes info such as
		- Device identifiers
		- IP addresses and prefix lengths
		- Interface identifiers
		- Routing protocols and static routes
		- Layer 2 info (VLANs, trunks, EtherChannels)

## Network Device Documentation
- Keeps records of the hardware and software used
- Some info is common in both router and LAN switch device documentations
	1. Device name
	2. Model
	3. Description
	4. IOS (switches, routers) / OS (servers and workstations)

**Router Device Documentation**
Info stored about the routers should include
1. Location
2. License
3. Interface info (addresses, routing info, desc, etc)

**LAN Switch Device Documentation**
Should include
1. Management IP address
2. VTP
3. Port info ( VLANs, Trunk, EtherChannel, port status-enable/shutdown)

**End-system Documentation**
Focuses on the hardware and software used in *servers*, *management consoles* and *user workstations*
Should include
1. Services being run
2. IP addresses
3. DNS
4. Default gateway

## Establish a Network Baseline
- Helps to determine when there is abnormal behaviour in the network. Can also help reveal problems such as potential congestion points and underutilised parts of the network
**Steps**
1. Determine what types of data to collect - According to company defined policies. Commonly collected data are *interface utilisation* and *CPU utilisation*.
2. Identify devices and ports of interest- Ports on edge devices, servers, key users, etc.
3. Determine the baseline duration - Should be **7 days** at min. Typically should not last more than **6 weeks**. Should not be performed at unique times like peak hours, but during normal operation

## Data Measurement
Can be done using commands such as *ping*, *traceroute*, *telnet* and *show*.

# Troubleshooting Process
The general troubleshooting process is
1. Gather symptoms
2. Isolate the problem
3. Implement corrective action
4. Document solution of problem is solved. Else, undo changes and go back go step 1.

## Seven-Step Troubleshooting Process
1. Define the problem
2. Gather info
