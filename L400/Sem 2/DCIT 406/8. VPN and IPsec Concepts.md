## Types of VPNs
**Remote-Access VPNs**
- Lets remote mobile users connect to the enterprise
- Usually enabled dynamically by the user when required
- Can be created using IPSec or SSL
- Clientless - Connection is secured using a web browser
- Client based - Uses client software on end-user's device

**SSL VPNs**
- Uses the public key infrastructure and digital certificates to authenticate
- IPsec and SSL VPNs are not mutually exclusive and can be implemented together

|Feature|IPsec|SSL|
|---|---|---|
|**Applications supported**|**Extensive** - All IP-based applications are supported.|**Limited** - Only web-based applications and file sharing are supported.|
|**Authentication strength**|**Strong** - Uses two-way authentication with shared keys or digital certificates.|**Moderate** - Using one-way or two-way authentication.|
|**Encryption strength**|**Strong** - Uses key lengths from 56 bits to 256 bits.|**Moderate to strong** - With key lengths from 40 bits to 256 bits.|
|**Connection complexity**|**Medium** - Because it requires a VPN client pre-installed on a host.|**Low** - It only requires a web browser on a host.|
|**Connection option**|**Limited** - Only specific devices with specific configurations can connect.|**Extensive** - Any device with a web browser can connect.|

**Site-to-Site IPsec VPNs**
- Connects networks across an untrusted networks

**GRE over IPsec**
- *Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)* , non-secure site-to-site VPN tunelling protocol
- Does not support encryption by default.
