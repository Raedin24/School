# Cloud Computing
**Uses**
1. Enable access to organisational data anywhere
2. Streamline IT operations by subscribing only to needed services
3. Reduces need for onsite IT equipment and maintenance
4. Reduces cost for equipment and power
5. Scalable

## Cloud Services
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - Cloud provider gives access to applications and services such as email, Office 365. User only provides data

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** - Cloud provider gives access to development tools and services. Usually given to *programmers*, who can configure the settings as needed

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** - Given to *IT managers*. Allows them to manage network equipment, virtualized network services, and other network infrastructure. Also allows them to deploy and run software, including OS and applications

- **IT Support as a Service (ITaaS)** - Not among the usual suite, but can be added on demand to support the services listed above

## Cloud Models
- **Public cloud** - Available to the general public. Free or pay-per-use.
- **Private cloud** - Intended for a specific organization/entity (eg. government). Can be set
