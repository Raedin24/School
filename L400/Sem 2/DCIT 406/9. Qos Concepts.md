# Network Transmission Quality
QoS is needed at points in the network where there is congestion. eg. Aggregation layer, where there is a speed mismatch (higher to lower ), gateways
> A device implements QoS only when experiencing congestion

## Bandwidth, Congestion, Delay, Jitter
*Bandwidth* - Measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second(bps)
*Congestion* - When an interface is presented with more traffic than it handle. 
*Delay / Latency* - Time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to destination. Classified into
	- **Fixed** - A specific amount of time a process takes. eg. how long it takes to place a bit on transmission media
	- **Variable** - Unspecified amount of time, affected by other factors
*Jitter* - Variation in the delay of received packets. Can be caused by network congestion, improper queuing, cong
>At the sending side, packets are sent in a continuous stream with the packets spaced evenly apart
### Sources of Delay

| **Delay**           | **Description**                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code delay          | The *fixed* amount of time it takes to compress data at the source before transmitting to the first internetworking device, usually a switch. |
| Packetization delay | The *fixed* time it takes to encapsulate a packet with all the necessary header information.                                                  |
| Queuing delay       | The *variable* amount of time a frame or packet waits to be transmitted on the link.                                                          |
| Serialization delay | The *fixed* amount of time it takes to transmit a frame onto the wire.                                                                        |
| Propagation delay   | The *variable* amount of time it takes for the frame to travel between the source and destination.                                            |
| De-jitter delay     | The *fixed* amount of time it takes to buffer a flow of packets and then send them out in evenly spaced intervals.                            |
