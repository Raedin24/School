# Network Transmission Quality
QoS is needed at points in the network where there is congestion. eg. Aggregation layer, where there is a speed mismatch (higher to lower ), gateways
> A device implements QoS only when experiencing congestion

## Bandwidth, Congestion, Delay, Jitter
*Bandwidth* - Measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second(bps)
*Congestion* - When an interface is presented with more traffic than it handle. 
*Delay / Latency* - Time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to destination. Classified into
	- **Fixed** - A specific amount of time a process takes. eg. how long it takes to place a bit on transmission media
	- **Variable** - Unspecified amount of time, affected by other factors
*Jitter* - Variation in the delay of received packets. Can be caused by network congestion, improper queuing, config errors
>At the sending side, packets are sent in a continuous stream with the packets spaced evenly apart
>Delay and Jitter need to be minimized to support real-time traffic
### Sources of Delay

| ***Delay***             | ***Description***                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code delay**          | The *fixed* amount of time it takes to compress data at the source before transmitting to the first internetworking device, usually a switch. |
| **Packetization delay** | The *fixed* time it takes to encapsulate a packet with all the necessary header information.                                                  |
| **Queuing delay**       | The *variable* amount of time a frame or packet waits to be transmitted on the link.                                                          |
| **Serialization delay** | The *fixed* amount of time it takes to transmit a frame onto the wire.                                                                        |
| **Propagation delay**   | The *variable* amount of time it takes for the frame to travel between the source and destination.                                            |
| **De-jitter delay**     | The *fixed* amount of time it takes to buffer a flow of packets and then send them out in evenly spaced intervals.                            |
## Packet Loss
- Without QoS, packets are processed in the order in which they are received.
- When a router receives a *Real-Time Protocol (RTP)* digital audio stream for VoIP, it must compensate for jitter.
**Playout Delay Buffer** - Mechanism that handles jitter compensation. Buffers the packets and plays them out in a steady stream.
- If the jitter is out of the range of the buffer, the out-of-range packets are discarded, causing dropouts in audio
**Digital Signal Processor (DSP)** - Interpolates what the audio should be like for small packet losses.
- If jitter exceeds the DSP's capability, audio problems are heard on by the end-user


# Traffic Characteristics
*Voice*  and *Video*  traffic are the primary reasons why QoS is needed

### Voice
- Uses RTP port range **16384 to 32767**  on Cisco Devices to prioritize traffic

| Voice Traffic Characteristics                                                   | One-Way Requirements                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Smooth<br>- Benign<br>- Drop sensitive<br>- Delay sensitive<br>- UDP priority | - Latency ≤ 150ms<br>- Jitter ≤ 30ms<br>- Loss ≤ 1% <br>- Bandwidth (30 - 128 Kbps) |

### Video
- Without QoS, video appears blurry or in slow motion. Audio may be unsynchronized with video
- Less resilient to loss and higher volume of data per packet as compared with voice.
- If the video stream consists of content that is not changing much from frame to frame, then the video packets will be small
- Uses *Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RSTP)*  ports such as **554**

| Video Traffic Characteristics                                                   | One-Way Requirements                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Bursty<br>- Greedy<br>- Drop sensitive<br>- Delay sensitive<br>- UDP priority | - Latency ≤ 200-400 ms<br>- Jitter ≤ 30-50 ms<br>- Loss ≤ 0.1 - 1%<br>- Bandwidth (384 Kbps -  20 Mbps) |
> Voice should get a higher priority than Video
### Data
- TCP performs error recovery. Best used for apps that have no tolerance for data loss (email, web pages)
- Network control traffic is usually smooth. Might burst for a few seconds when there is a topology change.
> Today's networks can easily handle the increase in network control traffic while convergence happens
> 
>Some TCP applications can consume a large portion of network capacity. FTP will consume as much bandwidth as it can get.  Hence Data tends to consume a lot.

| Data Traffic Characteristics                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Smooth/bursty<br>- Benign/greedy<br>- Drop insensitive<br>- Delay insensitive<br>- TCP retransmits |

To ensure the quality of user experience, a network admin needs to know **2** things about the flow of data traffic
1. Does the data come from an interactive application?
2. Is the data mission critical?

| Factor              | **Mission Critical**                                                                              | **Not Mission Critical**                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interactive**     | Prioritize for the lowest delay of all data traffic and strive for a 1 to 2 second response time. | Applications could benefit from lower delay.                                        |
| **Not interactive** | Delay can vary greatly as long as the necessary minimum bandwidth is supplied.                    | Gets any leftover bandwidth after all voice, video, and other data application need |

# Queuing Algorithms
- **Queuing** is a congestion management tool that can *buffer, prioritize*, and *reorder* packets before transmission
## First In First Out (FIFO)
- Buffers and forwards packets in the order of arrival
- Has no concept of priority or classes
- Only *one queue*, all packets treated equally
- Used by default (except on Serial interfaces at *EI*(2.048 Mbps) and below)
- Fastest queuing method, effective for large links with little congestion

## Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)
- Automated scheduling method
- Provides fair bandwidth allocation to all network traffic
