# NAT Characteristics
NAT  provides translation of private addresses to public addresses.
- NAT-enabled routers can be configured with more than **1** public address, known as the **NAT pool**
- NAT routers operated at the *border of a stub network*

|Class|RFC 1918 Internal Address Range|Prefix|
|---|---|---|
|A|10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255|10.0.0.0/8|
|B|172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255|172.16.0.0/12|
|C|192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255|192.168.0.0/16|
## NAT Terminology
NAT includes **4** types of addresses
1. Inside local address
2. Inside global address
3. Outside local address
4. Outside global address

Breaking these down:
- **Inside address** - Address of device to be translated
- **Outside address** - Address of the destination device
- **Local address** - An address on the inside portion of the network
- **Global address** - Address on the outside portion of the network
`NAT terminology is always applied from the perspective of the device with the translated adddress`
