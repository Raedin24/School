`OBJECTIVE - Explain how ACLs are used as part of a network security policy`

# 4.1 Purpose of ACLs
## What is an ACL
An **ACL** is a series of IOS commands used to filter packets based on info in the packet header
- Routers do not have ACLs by default
- ACL uses a sequential list to permit / deny *access control entries (ACEs)*  aka ACL statements
- The comparison process is known as *packet filtering*

### Uses of ACLs
1. Limit network traffic to increase network performance
2. Provide traffic flow control
3. Provide basic security for network access
4. Filter traffic based on traffic type
5. Permit / deny access to network services
6. Provide priority to certain classes of traffic 

## Packet Filtering
Controls access to a network by analyzing packets and
