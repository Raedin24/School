`OBJECTIVE - Explain how ACLs are used as part of a network security policy`

# 4.1 Purpose of ACLs
## What is an ACL
An **ACL** is a series of IOS commands used to filter packets based on info in the packet header
- Routers do not have ACLs by default
- ACL uses a sequential list to permit / deny *access control entries (ACEs)*  aka ACL statements
- The comparison process is known as *packet filtering*

### Uses of ACLs
1. Limit network traffic to increase network performance
2. Provide traffic flow control
3. Provide basic security for network access
4. Filter traffic based on traffic type
5. Permit / deny access to network services
6. Provide priority to certain classes of traffic 

## Packet Filtering
Controls access to a network by analyzing packets and forwarding / discarding them based on given criteria
- Occurs at layer 3 and 4
- Cisco routers support 2 ACL types
	1. **Standard ACL** - Only filters at layer 3 using source IPv4 addresses
	2. **Extended ACL** - Filters at layer 3 using source and / or destination IPv4 address. Can also filter at layer 4 using TCP, UDP and optional protocol info

## ACL Operation
- ACLs can be configured to apply to inbound and outbound traffic
- Does not act on packets that originate from the router itself

**Inbound ACL**
- Filters packets before they are routed to the outbound interface
- Efficient - No need for routing lookups if packet is discarded
- Best used to filter packets when network attached to the inbound interface is the only source of packets
> If the source IP does not match any ACE, packet is discarded by default

**Outbound ACL**
- Filters packets after being routed
- Best used when the same filter will be applied to packets from multiple inbound interfaces


```
show access-lists - Show all ACLs
show run | include interface|access - Shows running config, then selects those that have interface OR access
no access-list {ACL number} - Removes all / a specified ACL
```
