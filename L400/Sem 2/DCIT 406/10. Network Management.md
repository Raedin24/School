# Device Discovery with CDP
- **Cisco Discovery Protocol** is used to create a map of the network
- Is a *layer 2* protocol
- Gathers info about devices which share the same data link
- Is media and protocol independent, runs on all Cisco devices
- Works by sending periodic CDP advertisements to connected devices.
- Advertisements contain info about the *type* of device, *name*, and *number and type* of the interfaces
`CDP is enabled by default`

## Configure and Verify CDP
- CDP can be used by an attacker to gather
- `show cdp` is used to verify the status of CDP 
```
show cdp   // Verify cdp status and show info
cdp run    // Enable cdp globally
cdp enable // Enable cdp o
```
