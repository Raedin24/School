Radio waves were first known as *Hertzian Waves*. 
- Hertz showed that electromagnetic phenomena could be used to transfer energy between locations without a physical connection
- **Guglielmo Marconi** reproduced Hertz's experiment over greater distances
- Resulted in the first radio link (wireless telegraph)

# Mobile Systems
- Designed to operate over large areas with limited bandwidth
- Cellular mobile communication systems use large numbers of *low-power wireless transmitters*  to create cells
- Offers larger capacity through cell splitting.
- Cells can be sized according to subscriber density and demand by varying power levels
- Conversations are handed off to new cells as mobile users move from one region to another
- Channels / frequencies used in one cell can be reused in a cell in another region

# Communication Systems
- Used to distribute info from one location to another.
- Information is more conveniently shared as signals
- *Communication engineers*  are concerned with the transmission and reception of such signals
## Communication Process
1. Generation of message signal (*Voice*, *music, picture, etc* )
2. Description of message signal (*electrical, aural, visual*)
3. Coding of signal for transmission
4. Transmission
5. Decoding and reproduction of original signal
6. Recreation of original message signal
# Components of Communication System
1. Transmitter
2. Channel
3. Receiver

### Communication Channel
- Medium across which transmission takes place
- Grouped according to mode of transmission
	- Guided propagation (telephone, coaxial cable, optical fibre)
	- Free propagation (wireless broadcast, mobile radio)

# Cellular System Infrastructure
- Early mobile systems used one powerful transmitter located at a high spot to cover areas, with radius of up to **50km**
- Cellular systems use a number of low power transmitters to cover a large area
