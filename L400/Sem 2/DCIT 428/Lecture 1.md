Radio waves were first known as *Hertzian Waves*. 
- Hertz showed that electromagnetic phenomena could be used to transfer energy between locations without a physical connection
- **Guglielmo Marconi** reproduced Hertz's experiment over greater distances
- Resulted in the first radio link (wireless telegraph)

# Mobile Systems
- Designed to operate over large areas with limited bandwidth
- Cellular mobile communication systems use large numbers of *low-power wireless transmitters*  to create cells
- Offers larger capacity through cell splitting.
- Cells can be sized according to subscriber density and demand by varying power levels
- Conversations are handed off to new cells as mobile users move from one region to another
- Channels / frequencies used in one cell can be reused in a cell in another region

# Communication Systems
- Used to distribute info from one location to another.
- Information is more conveniently shared as signals
