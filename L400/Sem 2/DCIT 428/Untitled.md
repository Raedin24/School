## 
**Analog modulation types**
amplitude, frequency, phase

## Digital Modulation
- Encoding a digital signal onto an analog wave
- Useful when transmitting over a medium that does not accept digital signals
- Known as *line coding*
- Three basic types: *amplitude, frequency, phase*
- Main goal: To be robust against noise, inteference and other impariments
**Advantages**
1. Makes better use of bandwidth
2. Requires less power to transmit
3. Performs better when the signal experiences interference
4. More compatible with error-correcting techniques
