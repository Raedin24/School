Wireless systems are unguided.ie they do not use a physical medium
### Communication Process
- Generation of message signal
- Description of signal
- Coding of signal for transmission
- Transmission of encoded signal
- Decoding and reproduction of original signal
- Recreation of original message

> A **signal** is a single valued *function* of time (value changes with time)

### Components of Communication Systems
- Transmitter
- Channel
- Receiver
`Insert image of diagram of communication system here`

#### Modes of Transmission
1. Guided propagation 
    - Telephone
    - Coaxial cable
    - Optical fiber
2. Free propagation
    - Wireless broadcast channels
    - Radio channels
`Isotropic antennas transmit in all directions. Omnidirectional antennas transmit equally well in all directions.`
The coverage area of a transmitter is known as a **cell**. Cells are grouped into **clusters**

### Base Station
Base stations maintain 4 channels
- **FCC** - Forward (Downlink) control channel
- **RCC** - Reverse (Uplink) control channel
- **FTC** - Forward (Downlink) traffic channel
- **RTC** - Reverse (Uplink) traffic channel

## Components of a Cellular System
1. Mobile unit(phone)
2. Base station
3. Mobile switching center

An audio signal has a frequency of 30kHz
Wavelength of a signal is inversely proportional to it's frequency
Assume constant of proportionality to be c(speed of light)

>  Read on Shannon theory, sampling theory(nyquist)

**Shannon's Limit** is the limit on how much data can be pushed through any medium (air, water, etc)
