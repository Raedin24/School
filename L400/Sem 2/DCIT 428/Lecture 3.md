# Radio Frequency Communications
## Components of a Radio System
- Filter
- Mixer
- Amplifier
- Antenna
> Mixed signals are combined in such a way that the original signals can be extracted

### Filters
- Used to remove unwanted RF signals
- **RF Filter** - Passes or rejects signal based on frequency
- Used in transmitters to remove unwanted frequencies known as *harmonic oscillations*
> Harmonic oscillations result from the process of modulating the signal before transmission.
- **Intermediate frequency (IF)** signals are the output from the modulation process. Can be filtered using a bandpass filter.
#### Types of filters
1. **Low-pass filter** - Max frequency is set and all signals below that value is allowed
2. **High-pass filter** - Min frequency is set and all signals above that value is allowed
3. **Bandpass filter** - Sets a range called *passband*  and allows signals that fall within that range

> Signals can be decomposed into sin or cos waves using fourier transformations


#### Mixers
- Used to combine two radio frequen
