# Module 2: Detecting and Preventing System Intrusions
## Intrusion Terminology
- **Intrusion** - Malicious actors try to break into/disrupt a system
- **Intrusion detection** - Procedures and systems created to detect system intrusions.
- **Intrusion reaction** - Actions taken upon detecting intrusion
- **Intrusion correction** - Restoring normal operations
- **Intrusion prevention** - Actions to proactively deter intrusions

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Designed to monitor network/system activities for malicious/suspicious behaviour
- Works by analyzing incoming and outgoing traffic and system logs
### Terminologies
1. **Alert, Alarm** - Notification generated to indicate the detection of suspicious activity
2. **False Negative** - No problem detected, when there's a problem
3. **False Positive** - Problem detected, when there's no problem
4. **Confidence Value** - Represents the level of reliability assigned to an alert/detection event
5. **Alarm Filtering** - Prioritizing and managing alerts generated by an IDS to focus attention on critical events

### Uses of an IDS
1. Detects attacks
2. Detects and deals with preambles to attacks
3. Documents existing threats
4. Provides info about intrusions that occur
