- **transforms.Compose**: A function to chain multiple image transformation operations together. Here, `transforms.Resize((224, 224))` resizes the image to 224x224 pixels, and `transforms.ToTensor()` converts the image to a PyTorch tensor.
- **ImageFolder**: A dataset class for loading images from a directory where images are arranged in class-specific subdirectories.
- **DataLoader**: A PyTorch class that provides an efficient way to iterate over datasets.
- **torch.nn**: A PyTorch module containing neural network layers and loss functions.
- **torch.optim**: A PyTorch module containing optimization algorithms.
- **numpy**: A library for numerical computations.
- **tqdm**: A library to display progress bars.
