# Steps
1. Identify class of IP address and default subnet mask
2. Convert subnet mask to binary
3. Note the number of hosts required per subnet and find the subnet generator and octet position
4. Generate new subnet mask
5. Use subnet generator to find the network ranges(subnets)
|- - -|
| Subnet| - |1 |
| Host| - | 1 |
| Subnet Mask| - | 1 |

## Question 1

**Base IP Address** \- 192.168.4.0 / 24

| Host | Network Address | Broadcast Address | Subnet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 55  | 192.168.4.0 | 192.168.4.63 | /26 |
| 25  | 192.168.4.64 | 192.168.4.95 | /27 |
| 12  | 192.168.4.96 | 192.168.4.111 | /28 |
| 2   | 192.168.4.112 | 192.168.4.115 | /30 |
| 2   | 192.168.4.116 | 192.168.4.119 | /30 |
| 2   | 192.168.4.120 | 192.168.4.123 | /30 |

## Question 2

**Base IP Address** \- 172.16.0.0 / 16

| Host | Network Address | Broadcast Address | Subnet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11597 | 172.16.0.0 | 172.16.63.255 | /18 (255.255.192.0) |
| 1245 | 172.16.64.0 | 172.16.71.255 | /21 (255.255.248.0) |
| 597 | 172.16.72.0 | 172.16.75.255 | /22 |
| 297 | 172.16.76.0 | 172.16.77.255 | /23 |
| 97  | 172.16.78.0 | 172.16.78.127 | /25 |
| 17  | 172.16.78.128 | 172.16.78.159 | /27 |
| 2   | 172.16.78.160 | 172.16.78.163 | /30 |
| 2   | 172.16.78.164 | 172.16.78.167 | /30 |
| 2   | 172.16.78.168 | 172.16.78.171 | /30 |

| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 31, 23, 15, 7 | 30, 22, 14, 6 | 29, 21, 13, 5 | 28, 20, 12, 4 | 27, 19, 11, 3 | 26, 18, 10, 2 | 25, 17, 9, 1 | 24, 16, 8, 0 |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |

Every movement into the next octect add 1 to the subnet mask

## Question 3

Base IP Address - 172.16.1.0 / 24

| Host | N.A | B.A | Subnet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 125 | 172.16.1.0 | 172.16.1.127 | /25 (255.255.255.128) |
| 25  | 172.16.1.128 | 172.16.1.223 | /27 (255.255.255.224) |
| 12  | 172.16.1.160 | 172.16.1.175 | /28 (255.255.255.240) |
| 2   | 172.16.1.176 | 172.16.1.179 | /30 (255.255.255.252) |
| 2   | 172.16.1.180 | 172.16.1.183 | /30 (255.255.255.252) |
| 2   | 172.16.1.184 | 172.16.1.187 | /30 (255.255.255.252) |
