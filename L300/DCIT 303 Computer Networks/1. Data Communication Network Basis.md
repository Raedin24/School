# Summary

- Describes concept of network communication and data communication network
- Introduces network devices and topologies

* * *

Every action goes through:  
Terminal device - switch - router - firewall - modem - ATT Fiber - Internet. This is in the LAN

1\. Switches allow us to connect more than 1 computer/device together. A number of devices connected through a switch forms a network  
2\. Routers - Allow different switches(networks) to communicate  
3\. Firewalls - A firewall's job is to block unwanted access from outside the network or data leaks within the network

# 1\. Communication and Networks

```
1.1 Concept of Network communication 
```

Communication is the information transfer and exchange between people, between people and things, and between things through a certain medium and behaviour.
Network is formed by connecting computers in close proximity to a switch via network cables.
Network communication is communication between terminal devices through a computer network.

**Information Transfer Process**

- Application packs data into original "data payload", adds header and tail to form a packet (encapsulation). Important info in the packet is the destination address
- The packet is then sent to a gateway router. Gateway decapsulates packet, reads destination address, re-encapsulates packet. A gateway router is the one used to connect the computer to the internet.
- Packet is sent to a router based on destination address and then to the internet.
- The packet is sent through the internet to another gateway router.
- The packet is decapsulated and the payload(data) is taken out by the gateway router on the other end.

**Common Terms**

- Data payload : Information conveyed
- Packet : Data unit exchanged and transmitted on the network
- Header : Information segment added before the data payload
- Tail : Information segment added after the data payload. Packets may not have tails
- Encapsulation : Process of adding a head and tail to a data payload to form a new packet
- Decapsulation : The reverse
- Gateway : Network device that provides functions such as protocol conversion, route selection, and data exchange
- Router : Network device that selects a forwarding path for packets
- Terminal device : End device of a data communication system, used as a sender or receiver of data

1.2 Concept of Data Communication Network 
```

1\. **Switch**

- A device closest to end users, used to access the network and switch data frames.
- Network formed by a switch is a *broadcast domain*. ie. frames sent by one node can be received by the rest of the nodes. 
- Can be used to switch the data-frame from one computer to the server or another computer.
- Is a Layer 2 device (Data link layer of TCP/IP reference model)

2\. **Router**

- Used to forward a packet from one network to another network. 
- Selects a suitable path to deliver message to next router or destination.
- Maintains a Content Addressable Memory(CAM) table.
- Builds and maintains routing tables, runs routing protocols, allowing them to select the correct route and forward IP packets
- Performs NAT
- Forward IP messages
- Can also isolate one subnet from the other(isolate broadcast domains)
- Connects Layer 2 networks established through switches, connects to WANs
- Is a Layer 3 device (Network layer of TCP/IP)

3\. **Firewalls**

- Network security device used to ensure secure communication b/n networks.
	##### Functions
- Isolates networks of different security levels by implementing access control
- Implements user identity authentication and remote access
- Implements network address translation
- Implements data encryption and VPN services

4\. **Wireless Devices**
Common wireless devices are *access points (AP)*  and *access controllers (AC)*
- **Access Points**
	- Core of the wireless network.
	- Used for a wireless switch
	- Enables mobile computer users to access the wired network
	- Supports 3 working modes: *fat AP, fit AP, cloud AP*
		- **Fat AP**: Suitable for homes. Works independently, requires separate configuration, provides single function, is low-cost
		- **Fit AP**: Suitable for large and medium-sized enterprises. Needs to be used in conjuction with AC, requires unified management and configuration by AC, provides rich functions
		- **Cloud AP**: Is interconnected with cloud management platform. Capable of plug-and play deployment and cloud-based remote operation and maintenance. Preferred option for enterprises with several brnaches
- **Access Controller**
	- An access point control device of wireless LAN.
	- Responsible for converging and connecting data from different APs to the internet. Performs the configuration management of AP devices and control functions(authentication, management, broadband access) of wireless users
	- Generally located in the aggregation layer

1.3 Wireless Devices
```

- WLAN is a network that uses radio waves, lasers and infrared signals in place of transmission media.
    
- Common devices on WLAN include fat APs, fit APs, and ACs.
    
- AP
    
    - Supports fat AP, fit AP, and cloud-based management modes. Can switch b/n modes based on network planning requirements.
    - Fat AP: Applicable to homes. Works independently and needs to be configured separately. Simple functions and low cost
    - Fit AP: Applicable in medium to large-sized enterprises. Is managed and configured by AC
    - Cloud-based management: Applies to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Works with cloud-based management platforms for unified management and configuration.
- AC
    
    - Deployed at the aggregation layer of entire network to provide high-speed, secure WLAN services
    - Provides wireless data control services with large capacity, high performance, reliabiliy and easy installation and maintenance.

# 2\. Network Types and Topology Types

```
2.1 LAN, MAN, WAN
```

Networks can be classified based on geographic coverage or users.
## Classification by network geographical coverage
Local Area Networks(LANs), metropolitan area networks(MANs), and wide area networks(WANs)

- **LAN** : Consists of computers, servers and network devices in a close geographic area. 
	- Used mainly to connect terminal computers in close proximity. 
	- Coverage is within several 1000sq meters
	- Usually set up by organizations independently
	- Tech used: Wi-Fi, Ethernet
- **MAN** : Computer communication network established between LANs within a city. Generally a larger LAN.
	- Typical MANs are broadband MANs, education MANs.
	- Similar to WANs in role, but different in implementation
	- Tech used: Ethernet, Word Interoperability for Microwave Access(WiMAX)
- **WAN** : Connects networks of multiple cites or countries and provides long distance communication. 
	- Ranges b/n 10's sq - 1000's sq meters.
	- Requires the lease of line of the ISP, and payment to the ISP for bandwidth every year. Fee is related to bandwidth size
	- Tech used: PPP, PPPoE, HDLC.

## Classification by Users
Public and private networks
- **Public**  - A large network funded by a telecom company. Open to everyone willing to pay for it. eg. Internet
- **Private** - Built for the special business needs of the organization. Does not provide services to people outside the organization

```
3.1 Network Topologies
```

A network topology is a structured layout used to describe the physical or logical structure of a network.

![Network Topology types.png](../_resources/Network%20Topology%20types.png)

1.  **Star Network** : All nodes are connected through a central node.
    - Advantages
        - New nodes can easily be added
        - Communication data must be forwarded by central node, which allows network monitoring
    - Disadvantages
        - Faults on central node affect communication of entire network
2.  **Bus Network** : All nodes are connected through a bus. (eg coaxial cable)
    - Advantages
        - Installation is simple, does not require many cables
        - Failure of a node doesn't affect communication on the network
    - Disadvantages
        - Bus is occupied when 2 devices are communicating and other devices cannot communicate
        - Bus fault affects communication of entire network
        - Information sent by a node can be received by all other nodes, low security
3.  **Ring Network** : All nodes are connected to form a closed ring.
    - Advantages
        - Cable resources are saved
    - Disadvantages
        - Difficult to add new nodes, since ring must be interrupted
4.  **Tree Network** : Actually a hierarchical / layered star structure.
    - Advantages
        - Multiple star networks can be quickly combined, facilitating network expansion.
    - Disadvantages
        - A fault on a node at a higher layer severely affects network
5.  **Full-mesh Network** : All nodes are interconnected through cables.
    - Advantages
        - Has high reliability and communication efficiency
    - Disadvantages
        - Each node requires a large number of physical ports and interconnection cables. Results in high cost and difficulty in expanding network
6.  **Partial-mesh Network** : Only key nodes are interconnected.
    - Advantages
        - Cost is lower than a full-mesh
    - Disadvantages
        - Reliability and communication efficiency is lower than a full-mesh network

`In actual networking, multiple topologies may be combined based on cost, communication efficiency and reliability requirements. This is known as a Hybrid network. However redundant equipment and cables are required`
