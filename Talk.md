“God Has a Name”—Psalm 83:18; Jeremiah 10:10

Kofi. Akosua. Yaw. Akua. These are all names that are common among the Akan people in Ghana. In that tradition, a child is named based on the day of the week they were born. These names are not random—they carry meaning, identity, and cultural heritage. Even twins receive distinct names that help tell them apart and reflect their individuality.

In addition to these traditional names, many Ghanaians also have English names, often referred to as "Christian names." So, you’ll often hear combinations like *Stephen Agyeman*, *Reginald Dussi*, or *James Awuku*. These names reflect both our cultural background and our exposure to different languages and traditions.

But it doesn’t stop there. We give names to our pets, our businesses, and sometimes even to objects we grow fond of—like our favorite car or toy. Why do we do that? Because a name is not just a label. A name reflects a personal connection. It gives identity. It shows that the person—or thing—matters to us.

So if we, as humans, go to such great lengths to name the things and people we care about, wouldn’t it make sense that the one who created us—the Source of life—also has a name?

That’s a reasonable question to ask. And thankfully, the Bible gives us the answer.

Let’s read Psalm 83:18 together. It says:

> *“May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth.”*

Yes, God has a name—Jehovah. This scripture makes it clear: Jehovah is not just a title like “God” or “Lord.” Those are descriptions of His position or role, but Jehovah is His *personal name*. It identifies Him uniquely and sets Him apart from anything or anyone else.

Why is knowing that name important?

Think of how we feel when someone remembers our name. It makes us feel seen and valued. When you know someone’s name, you can form a personal relationship with them. You can call out to them, speak to them directly, and get to know who they are. Jehovah wants the same with us. He wants us to draw close to Him—not just to know *about* Him, but to know Him *personally*. And one way to start doing that is by knowing and using His name.

Let’s go a step further and learn more about who Jehovah is. Please turn with me to Jeremiah 10:10. It reads:

> *“But Jehovah is truly God. He is the living God and the eternal King. Because of his indignation the earth will quake, And no nations will endure his denunciation.”*

This verse paints a powerful picture of Jehovah. He is not just one god among many. He is the true God—the living God, and the eternal King. That means He is alive, active, and in complete control.

When we use His name, we’re not just using a word—we’re acknowledging someone real, someone personal. The more we use that name in our prayers, our conversations, and our thoughts, the more real Jehovah becomes to us.

So what should we do with this knowledge?

Let’s conclude by turning to Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14, which gives us timeless guidance:

> *“The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man. For the true God will judge every deed, including every hidden thing, as to whether it is good or bad.”*

This scripture reminds us of our purpose in life. Did you notice it? *“This is the whole obligation of man.”* In other words, this is what life is really about. We are not here just to build a name for ourselves, or simply enjoy temporary pleasures. We are here to *fear the true God*, to *know Him*, and to *obey Him*. And that begins by recognizing Him for who He truly is—Jehovah, the Most High over all the earth.

So, dear friends, let’s not treat Jehovah’s name casually, or as just another religious word. Let’s honor that name. Let’s draw close to Jehovah by getting to know Him through His Word, talking to Him in prayer, and living in a way that shows respect for His standards. Because when we do that, we not only fulfill our purpose—we also gain Jehovah’s friendship and His approval, both now and in the future.

May we all make it our goal to know Jehovah by name, to love Him deeply, and to live in a way that brings glory to that name.
